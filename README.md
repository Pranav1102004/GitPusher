# GitPusher

GitPusher is a Python GUI application designed to simplify the process of pushing your project to a GitHub repository. This tool provides a user-friendly interface where you can enter your GitHub credentials, specify the repository name, and select the local directory of your project. GitPusher then automates the process of authenticating with GitHub, cloning the repository (if it doesn't exist), copying your project files into the repository directory, and finally adding, committing, and pushing the changes to GitHub.
